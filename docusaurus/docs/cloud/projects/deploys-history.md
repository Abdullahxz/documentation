# Deploy history and logs

From the overview of a Strapi Cloud project, you can access its deploy history and the runtime logs of the latest deployment.

## Viewing deploy history

The *Deploys* tab of a Strapi Cloud project gives access to the list of all deployments for the project, as well as related deployment logs and details.

  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/cloud/deploys.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/cloud/deploys_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

In the *Deploys* tab is displayed a chronological list of cards with the details of all historical deployments for your project.

Each card displays the following information:
* Commit SHA <Annotation>ðŸ’¡ The commit SHA (or hash) is the unique ID of your commit, which refers to a specific change that was made at a specific time.</Annotation>, with a direct link to your git provider, and commit message
* Deployment status:

    * *Done*
    * *Cancelled*
    * *Build failed*
    * *Deploy failed*
* Last deployment time (when the deployment was triggered and the duration)
* Production branch

The cards also display a See logs button to access the deployment details (see [Triggering and managing deployments](#triggering-and-managing-deployments)).
