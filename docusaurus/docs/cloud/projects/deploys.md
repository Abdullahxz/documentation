# Projects deployments

Introduction.

## Triggering a new deployment

To trigger a new deployment for your project, click on the **Trigger deploy** button always displayed in the top right corner of the interface. This action will add a new card in the *Deploys* tab, where you can monitor the status and view the deployment logs live (see blabla).

## Cancelling a deployment

If for any reason you want to cancel an ongoing, unfinished deployment:

1. Go to the Log details page of the deployment (see Accessing log details).
2. Click on the **Cancel deploy** button in the top right corner. The status of the deployment will automatically change to *Cancelled*.

:::tip
You can also cancel a deployment from the *Deploys* tab which lists the deployments history. The card of ongoing deployment with the *Building* status will display a **Cancel deploy** button.
